### PROJECT TITLE: Edmonton City Food Drive Optimization

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. 


### Problem Statement

Edmonton's food donation management system is currently facing logistical challenges. In this city-wide community project, we want to develop an app that promotes community engagement among Edmonton residents. This app should be a simple but versatile tool, it must bring the community together seamlessly by being user-friendly and accessible on the go.

### Solution

We propose to create a food drive management system using Machine Learning models to streamline the process of data collection to provide accurate and reliable insights.

Input:
- Collect information on the estimated time needed to gather food.
- Identify routes requiring additional assistance.
- Track the total donations collected per year or per drive.
- Maintain a record of the number of volunteers available


Goals/Tasks:
- Efficiently manage and track food drive goals and tasks.
- Ensure inclusivity by providing user-friendly and accessible tools for both volunteers and organizers.
- Streamline data processing and model training times.
- Accurately estimate the time required to complete a food drive route.
